<h1>Number Guessing game</h1>
<h3>Powered by:</h3> <h2>WARAV</h2>

🎮 I have developed a number guessing game using the C++ programming language 💻. This project was created as part of a university assignment 📚, where the primary requirement was to utilize only the basic concepts of C++ without incorporating any advanced libraries or frameworks 🚫📦. As a result, the game does not include any graphical elements 🎨🖼️ since I was not permitted to use libraries like SFML or similar tools to enhance the visuals.

🔢 The game is designed to focus purely on logic 🧠 and functionality ⚙️, showcasing my understanding of fundamental programming concepts such as loops 🔁, conditional statements ❓✅, functions 📂, and random number generation 🎲🔢. Despite the absence of advanced graphics, the game offers an engaging and interactive experience 🎉🕹️ by challenging users to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range.

💡 This project not only highlights my proficiency in C++ 💻🎓 but also demonstrates my ability to work within constraints 🧱 and deliver functional results ✅🔥. It serves as an excellent example of how creativity 🌟 and problem-solving 🛠️ can be applied to develop an enjoyable game, even with limited resources.

✨ I’m thrilled to explore more opportunities 🚀🚪 to enhance my programming skills and create even more dynamic, visually appealing projects in the future! 🌈📈
